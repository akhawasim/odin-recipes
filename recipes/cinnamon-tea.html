    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>I make this cinnamon tea every now and then, when I pull out the German china tea set my mother-in-law brought home from one of her trips.
        <br>It makes me feel special, and I can take pleasure in remembering her as I savor each sip. 
        <br>I like cinnamon stick tea in the afternoon, because itâ€™s warm and comforting, and there is no caffeine! 
        <br>Try it with a lemon slice, and a drizzle of honey, or use whatever sweetener you prefer.
